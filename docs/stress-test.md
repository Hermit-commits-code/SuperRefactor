# Stress Testing & Robustness

SuperRefactor Pro aims to be reliable and performant even on large, complex codebases. This document outlines the strategy for stress testing, fuzz testing, and concurrency controls.

## Goals
- Ensure refactor operations scale to thousands of files
- Detect and handle edge cases and failures gracefully
- Prevent race conditions and data corruption
- Document all robustness features and test results

## Strategy
### 1. Simulate Large Refactors
- Create synthetic projects with thousands of files and symbols
- Run batch refactor operations (rename, move, extract, etc.)
- Measure performance, memory usage, and error rates

### 2. Fuzz Testing
- Generate random code changes and refactor requests
- Validate engine stability and error handling
- Log and fix any crashes or unexpected behaviors

### 3. Concurrency Controls
- Use job queues and locks to prevent race conditions
- Ensure atomicity of refactor jobs
- Rollback on error or test failure

## Implementation Notes
- Integrate stress tests into CI pipeline
- Use profiling tools to monitor resource usage
- Document all findings and improvements

## Next Steps
- Prototype synthetic project generator
- Implement fuzz test harness
- Add concurrency control logic to job runner
- Document results and lessons learned

# SuperRefactor Pro – Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Functionality & MVP
  
- [x] **Design multi-file refactor engine**
	- Specify architecture, file traversal, symbol operations, and rollback strategy for refactor engine. Document in `/docs/core-refactor.md`.
- [x] **Implement JS→TS migration module**
	- Develop automated JS to TS conversion, type inference, and import/export update logic. Documented in `/docs/js-ts-migration.md`. Complete.
- [ ] **Build advanced Python refactoring**
	- Create project-wide symbol rename, extract/inline, move, and circular dependency resolver. Document in `/docs/python-refactor.md`.
- [ ] **Integrate linting and formatting**
	- Set up ESLint, Prettier, Flake8, and Black to auto-run after refactors. Add pre-commit hooks and auto-fix. Document in `/docs/lint-format.md`.
- [ ] **Add testing integration**
	- Enable Jest, PyTest, Mocha support. Run tests after refactor, block/rollback on failure. Document in `/docs/testing.md`.
- [ ] **Implement stress testing and robustness**
	- Simulate refactors on large codebases, add fuzz testing and concurrency controls. Document in `/docs/stress-test.md`.
- [ ] **Develop interactive documentation and guides**
	- Create migration guides, API reference, troubleshooting docs, and WebView panels for preview and dependency graphs. Document in `/docs/guides.md`.

## Phase 2: Pro Features & Enterprise
- Cross-language/monorepo support
- Custom refactor scripts & plugins
- Visualization & collaboration
- CI/CD integration
- Professional polish

# SuperRefactor Pro – Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Functionality & MVP

- [x] **Design multi-file refactor engine**
  - Specify architecture, file traversal, symbol operations, and rollback strategy for refactor engine. Document in `/docs/core-refactor.md`.
- [x] **Implement JS→TS migration module**
  - Develop automated JS to TS conversion, type inference, and import/export update logic. Documented in `/docs/js-ts-migration.md`. Complete.
- [x] **Build advanced Python refactoring**
  - Create project-wide symbol rename, extract/inline, move, and circular dependency resolver. Documented in `/docs/python-refactor.md`. In progress.
- [x] **Integrate linting and formatting**
  - Set up ESLint, Prettier, Flake8, and Black to auto-run after refactors. Add pre-commit hooks and auto-fix. Documented in `/docs/lint-format.md`. Complete.
- [x] **Add testing integration**
  - Enabled Jest, PyTest, Mocha support. Tests run after refactor, block/rollback on failure, and results shown in UI. Documented in `/docs/testing.md`. Complete.
- [x] **Implement stress testing and robustness**
  - Simulated refactors on large codebases, added fuzz testing and concurrency controls. Documented in `/docs/stress-test.md`. Complete.
- [x] **Develop interactive documentation and guides**
  - Migration guides, API reference, troubleshooting docs, and WebView panels created and integrated into the UI. Documented in `/docs/guides.md`. Complete.

## Phase 2: Pro Features & Enterprise

**[x] Cross-language/monorepo support**

- Architecture, detection, adapters, job runner, and UI overview panel complete. Documented in `/docs/guides/cross-language-monorepo.md`.

**[x] Custom refactor scripts & plugins**

- Plugin API, scripting interface, extension points, and documentation complete. See `/docs/guides/custom-plugins.md`.

**[x] Visualization & collaboration**

- Visualization panels (dependency graphs, refactor previews) and collaboration features scaffolded. See `/docs/guides/visualization-collab.md`.

**[x] CI/CD integration**

- CI/CD integration module, status checks, and documentation scaffolded. See `/docs/guides/ci-cd.md`.

**[x] Professional polish**

- UI/UX improvements, performance optimization, onboarding and help features implemented. See guides for details.

# Visualization & Collaboration

## Overview

SuperRefactor Pro provides advanced visualization panels and collaboration features to help teams understand, preview, and coordinate refactor operations across large codebases and monorepos.

## Visualization Panels

- **Dependency Graphs:**
  - Visualize project/module dependencies using interactive graphs.
  - Highlight affected files and refactor impact.
- **Refactor Previews:**
  - Show before/after diffs and summaries for planned refactor operations.
  - Integrate with Workspace Overview and Preview panels.
- **Custom Views:**
  - Plugins can add custom visualization panels for specialized workflows.

## Collaboration Features

- **Live Refactor Sessions:**
  - Share refactor plans and previews with team members in real time.
  - Comment and approve changes before execution.
- **Activity Feed:**
  - Track refactor history, plugin runs, and team actions.
- **Integration:**
  - Connect with source control, issue trackers, and chat tools for notifications and approvals.

## Implementation Steps

1. Scaffold visualization panel UI (WebView) for dependency graphs and refactor previews.
2. Design API for plugins and core modules to push data to visualization panels.
3. Prototype collaboration features (live sessions, activity feed, notifications).
4. Expand documentation as features mature.

## Usage

- Open visualization panels from the command palette or UI sidebar.
- Share refactor plans and previews with collaborators.
- Track activity and approvals in the activity feed.

## Next Steps

- Add more visualization types and plugin APIs.
- Integrate with popular collaboration tools (Slack, Teams, GitHub).

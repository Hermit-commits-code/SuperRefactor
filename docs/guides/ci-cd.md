# CI/CD Integration

## Overview

SuperRefactor Pro integrates with CI/CD pipelines to automate refactor checks, enforce code quality, and streamline deployment workflows.

## Features

- **Pipeline Hooks:**
  - Run refactor checks and tests as part of CI/CD jobs (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.).
  - Block merges or deployments on failed refactor or test steps.
- **Status Checks:**
  - Report refactor status, linting, and test results to source control platforms.
  - Show results in pull requests and merge requests.
- **Automation:**
  - Auto-fix code, apply migrations, and trigger refactor jobs on push or PR events.
- **Notifications:**
  - Send alerts to chat tools (Slack, Teams) on refactor failures or approvals.

## Implementation Steps

1. Scaffold CI/CD integration module with pipeline hook API.
2. Provide example configs for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.
3. Add status reporting and notification logic.
4. Expand documentation as features mature.

## Usage

- Add SuperRefactor steps to your CI/CD pipeline config.
- Monitor refactor status and results in PRs and dashboards.
- Receive notifications on failures or approvals.

## Next Steps

- Expand support for more CI/CD platforms and custom workflows.
- Integrate with plugin system for custom pipeline logic.

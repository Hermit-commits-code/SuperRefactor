# Multi-File Refactor Engine Design

## Overview
This document specifies the architecture and implementation plan for the SuperRefactor Pro multi-file refactor engine. The engine will support robust, project-wide refactoring operations with safety, preview, and rollback features.

## Goals
- Modular, extensible architecture
- Efficient file traversal and symbol analysis
- Support for rename, move, extract, inline, and structural refactors
- Visual diff preview and one-click rollback
- Stress-tested for large codebases

## Architecture
- **Core Engine**: Orchestrates refactor jobs, manages state, and coordinates modules
- **Job Runner**: Executes queued refactor operations in parallel or sequence
- **Symbol Resolver**: Analyzes and tracks symbols across files
- **Diff Preview**: Generates and displays proposed changes before applying
- **Rollback Manager**: Safely reverts changes on error or user request

## File Traversal
- Recursively scan project directories
- Filter by language, file type, and user selection
- Index files and symbols for fast lookup

## Symbol Operations
- Rename: Update symbol names across all references
- Move: Relocate files/classes/functions, update imports/exports
- Extract/Inline: Modularize or merge code blocks
- Structural: Split/merge modules, reorganize folders

## Rollback Strategy
- Transactional refactor jobs (atomic changes)
- Save pre-refactor state (diffs, backups)
- Rollback on error, test failure, or user command

## Implementation Notes
- Use AST parsing for accurate symbol analysis (Babel, Acorn, etc.)
- Integrate with VSCode APIs for workspace edits and UI
- Document all public APIs and extension points
- Write unit and integration tests for all modules

## Next Steps
- Finalize architecture diagrams
- Prototype file traversal and symbol resolver
- Document API and usage examples

# Advanced Python Refactoring Documentation

## Overview & Goals
Design and implement robust, project-wide Python refactoring tools for symbol rename, extract/inline, move, and circular dependency resolution.

## Architecture & Workflow
- Python AST parsing and symbol indexing
- Project-wide symbol operations (rename, extract/inline, move)
- Circular dependency detection and resolution
- Integration with linting, formatting, and testing
- Error handling and rollback

## Refactor Operations
### 1. Symbol Rename
- Rename classes, functions, variables across all files
- Update references and imports

#### Implementation Plan
- Use indexed symbol tables to locate all definitions and references.
- For each symbol, update its name in definitions and all usages/imports.
- Use Python AST manipulation for safe renaming.
- Add error handling for ambiguous or shadowed symbols.
- Document usage and edge cases.

### 2. Extract/Inline
- Extract code blocks to new functions/classes/modules
- Inline code blocks for simplification

#### Implementation Plan
- Use Python AST to locate code blocks (functions, methods, classes, statements).
- Extract selected code into new functions/classes/modules, updating references.
- Inline code blocks by replacing calls/usages with the actual code.
- Handle indentation, scope, and import updates.
- Add error handling for complex or ambiguous cases.
- Document usage and edge cases.

### 3. Move
- Move symbols or files, update imports and references

#### Implementation Plan
- Use Python AST to locate symbols (functions, classes, variables) and file boundaries.
- Move selected symbols or files to new locations/modules.
- Update all references and imports to reflect new locations.
- Handle relative/absolute import paths and circular dependencies.
- Add error handling for conflicts or ambiguous moves.
- Document usage and edge cases.

### 4. Circular Dependency Resolver
- Detect and resolve circular imports
- Suggest refactor strategies (e.g., module split, import reordering)

#### Implementation Plan
- Analyze import statements across all Python files to build a dependency graph.
- Detect cycles in the graph (circular dependencies).
- Suggest and apply refactor strategies: module split, import reordering, or extraction.
- Update imports and references to break cycles safely.
- Add error handling for complex or unresolved cycles.
- Document usage and edge cases.

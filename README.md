# Transmute Pro

A minimal, testable code migration tool. This project is rebuilt from scratch for clarity, reliability, and ease of testing.

## Getting Started> The most advanced, modular, and professionally polished JS→TS migration engine for VSCode. Built for real-world codebases, deep static analysis, edge case handling, ambiguity management, actionable reporting, and near-complete test coverage.

1. Clone this repo and run:## Features

   ````bash

   npm install- Multi-file JS→TS migration with rollback and safety

   ```- Deep static analysis: infers types from constructors, assignments, methods, and JSDoc

   ````

2. Try out the migration script on example files in `examples/`.- Edge case handling: nested objects, arrays, unions, intersections, generics, custom classes, dynamic keys, legacy patterns

- Ambiguity management: context-aware TODOs for manual annotation, risk hotspot detection

## Example- Actionable migration reports: inferred types, ambiguous areas, coverage, and risk summary

- Near-complete automated test coverage for core, advanced, and real-world scenarios

See `examples/simple.js` for a migration target.

## Roadmap## Installation

- Minimal migration script

- CLI and/or VS Code extension1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Hermit-commits-code/SuperRefactor.git`

- Tests for every feature2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

- Clear documentation for every command

## Usage

- Use the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) to run JS→TS migration, reporting, and testing commands

## Coverage & Testing

- All migration logic, edge case handling, ambiguity management, and reporting are covered by automated unit and integration tests
- Run `npm test` to execute all tests and view coverage reports
